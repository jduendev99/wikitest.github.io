## <Highlight color='#800031' highlight='fg' fontWeight='bold'> Linux Shells </Highlight>

When we open up our terminal, chances are that it uses Bash as its UNIX shell environment. But other **shell** environments exist such as the C Shell, Korn Shell, Z Shell, and even the Fish Shell. All of these different shell environments have their own pros and cons, and you should consider them before you choose one to use on your own system.

<!--truncate-->

1. The <Highlight color='#25c2a0'> Bash </Highlight> Shell (or the **B**ourne **A**gain **Sh**ell) is a UNIX shell and command language. It was written by Brain Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne Shell (**sh**). 

    * It was first released in 1989. Bash is one of the first programs that Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) ported to Linux.

    * User configuration settings are in `.bashrc` (short for **bash** **r**ead **c**ommand).

    * Something you should not get confused about is that Bash is also a programming language. So it's a "Shell", but you can also program behavior in Bash. For example:

		```sh
		#!/bin/bash
		echo "Hello World"
		```

2. The <Highlight color='#25c2a0'> Z Shell </Highlight>, or <Highlight color='#25c2a0'> Zsh </Highlight> is also a UNIX shell that is very similar to Bash. Zsh is an extension of the Bourne shell with a lot of improvements. Zsh was released in 1990 by Paul Falstad, and it has some features that Bash, Korn Shell, and C Shell share.

    * The name zsh derives from the name of Yale professor **Z**hong **Sh**ao (then a teaching assistant at Princeton University) â€“ Paul Falstad regarded Shao's login-id, <Highlight color='#25c2a0'> zsh </Highlight>, as a good name for a shell
    * macOS by default uses the Zsh Shell.
    * Zshell Supports plugins and themes. Here's a [list of plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins) available for Zsh.
    * There are also frameworks built around the Z Shell. One of the most popular ones is [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), which is a community driven, open-source framework for managing Zsh configuration.

3. <Highlight color='#25c2a0'> Fish </Highlight>, the **F**riendly **I**nteractive **SH**ell, is a more recent addition to the world of shell environments. It prioritizes user-friendliness and simplicity, making it a great choice for newcomers to programming. It was created by Axel Liljencrantz in 2005.

### <Highlight color='#004080' highlight='fg' fontWeight='bold'> Install Fish or Zsh on Ubuntu </Highlight>

1. Update the package source list and updates all the packages presently installed

		```sh
		sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
		```
2. Install fish/zsh

		```sh
		# install fish
		sudo apt install fish
		# install z shell
		sudo apt install zsh
		```
3. Verify the installed version of the shell

		```sh
		zsh --version
		# zsh 5.8.1 (x86_64-ubuntu-linux-gnu)
		bash --version
		# GNU bash, version 5.1.16(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
		fish --version
		# fish, version 3.3.1
		```

    <Highlight color='#25c2a0'> GNU </Highlight> is a recursive acronym for <Highlight color='#004080' highlight='fg' fontWeight='bold'> GNU's Not Unix! </Highlight>

4. Set fish or zsh or bash as your default shell.

		```sh
		# for fish
		chsh -s $(which fish)
		# for zsh
		chsh -s $(which zsh)
		# for bash
		chsh -s $(which bash)
		```
		
		Restart the terminal window and check the current shell by `echo $SHELL`.

## <Highlight color='#800031' highlight='fg' fontWeight='bold'> Current git branch name to bash shell in Ubuntu (WSL) </Highlight>

Make your life easier as a developer and know the current branch in your workspace without complications. And the best? Without installing anything additional!

1. Open the `bashrc` file and look for the variable `$PS1`, which is the enviroment variable that store the default prompt setting we see every time when we log in the console.

```bash
cat ~/.bashrc
```

2. edit the `.bashrc` file as shown below under **New Bashrc** tab using your editor such as nano, vi, vim, etc and save

	```sh
	nano ~/.bashrc
	```

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="default" label="Default Bashrc" default>
```sh
if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ]; then
# highlight-next-line
    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
else
# highlight-next-line
    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
fi
unset color_prompt force_color_prompt
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="modified" label="New Bashrc">
```bash
# highlight-start
# git branch info if present
parse_git_branch() {
    git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}
# highlight-end

if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ]; then
# highlight-next-line
    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[35m\]$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[36m\]\$\[\033[00m\] '
else

    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w$(parse_git_branch)\$ '
fi
unset color_prompt force_color_prompt
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

3. To apply the settings, it is necessary to reload the file. We can do this by restarting the terminal or simply reloading the configuration file as below:

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```
