<Highlight color='#800031' highlight='fg' fontWeight='bold'> ECMA-262</Highlight>  - This is a standard published by <Highlight color='#1877F2' highlight='fg' fontStyle='italic'>Ecma International</Highlight>. It contains the specification for a general purpose scripting language. While ECMA-262 is the name of the standard, it represents the scripting language specification ECMAScript. ECMAScript provides the rules, details, and guidelines that a scripting language must observe to be considered ECMAScript compliant.

:::info[One more interesting tidbit]
A confusing bit of history is that JavaScript was created in 1996. It was then submitted to Ecma International in 1997 for standardization, which resulted in ECMAScript. At the same time, because JavaScript conformed to the ECMAScript specification, JavaScript is an example of an ECMAScript implementation.

That leaves us with this fun fact: ***ECMAScript is based on JavaScript***, and ***JavaScript is based on ECMAScript***.
