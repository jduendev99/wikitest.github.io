You've heard the age-old riddle: "Which came first: the chicken or the egg?" Taken metaphorically, it's a meditation on the futility of determining the cause of a self-perpetuating cycle. Taken literally, it's a great question for evolutionary biologists.

Chickens come from eggs, but eggs come from chickens. So which came first?

Which came first, *the chicken* or *the egg*?
